# selenium-js-examples

To run the examples:

1. The dependencies are in the folder "testconfig-items"
2. Packages are in the folder "packages"

If using the testgold UI, you need to add dependencies by adding every file under testconfig-items. You can add a package from any of the examples under packages, remember to add the .tar.gz as the package. login-page-xpaths.yaml should be set as a data file for the tests.
